# Fairfax-Real-Estate-Project


##Project Objective
-

The goal of my project is focused on the comparison of 2010 to 2015 property sales data to their 2025 assessed values. My analysis answers the following questions:

-- What year did each property size category have the highest annual appreciation compared to their 2025 assessed value?
-- What property size category appreciated the most overall?
-- which year has the biggest price gaps?
-- What properties are more likely to sell further below or above their 2025 assessed values?



##Dataset
-
-- Source: I recieved my datasets from https://data.virginia.gov/

-- Raw Data: The datasets I worked with consisted of three large CSV files containing 2025 assessed property values, land information, and property sales data for Fairfax County, Virginia. Each dataset included a common key called parcel IDs which allowed me to accurately join the data across the files. Altogether, the combined datasets contained over one million rows of information, featuring numerous null, missing, and outlier values. The data was cleaned and processed using PostgreSQL before visualization. I applied comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to address these issues, followed by exploratory data analysis and complex querying to extract valuable insights.
