##Project Objective

The goal of my project is to focus on the comparison of 2010 to 2015 sales data to their 2025 assessed property values. My analysis determines:
--
--
-- Which sales year had the largest price gaps between sales price and its 2025 assessed value?
-- Are larger properties more likely to sell further below or above their 2025 assessed value?
-- What year did each property size caategory have the highest annuel appreciation?
-- What Property size category appreciated the most overall?
